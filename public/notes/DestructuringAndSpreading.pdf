Destructuring

Unpacks values from arrays or objects into separate variables.
Makes code more concise and readable.
Destructuring Arrays:

Extract specific elements by their indices.
Skip elements with commas.
Assign default values to handle undefined elements.
Use the rest operator (...) to capture remaining elements as a new array.
Destructuring Objects:

Extract properties by their names.
Rename properties during destructuring.
Assign default values for missing properties.
Spread Operator (...)

Expands iterables (arrays, objects) into individual elements.
Used for:
Copying arrays or objects.
Combining arrays or objects.
Accepting unlimited function arguments.
Key Uses:

Structuring function parameters: Extract values directly from arguments.
Iterating over arrays of objects: Access properties concisely.
Combining and copying arrays/objects: Create new collections efficiently.
Creating flexible functions: Handle variable-length argument lists.
